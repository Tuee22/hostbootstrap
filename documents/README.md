# Documents

This directory is the single source of truth for hostbootstrap's design,
toolchain, and engineering practices. The repository
[`README.md`](../README.md) is a concise adoption guide; the deep technical
material lives here.

* [documentation_standards.md](documentation_standards.md) — authoritative doc
  conventions for this repository.

## Engineering references

* [engineering/schema.md](engineering/schema.md) — the `hostbootstrap.dhall`
  project-config schema, its three execution models, and how illegal states
  are rejected.
* [engineering/base_image.md](engineering/base_image.md) — the four
  `basecontainer-<flavor>-<arch>` tags and what they contain.
* [engineering/build_release.md](engineering/build_release.md) — base-image
  build, publish, and `--build-base` semantics.
* [engineering/prerequisites.md](engineering/prerequisites.md) — substrate
  prereqs absorbed by `hostbootstrap doctor`.
* [engineering/testing.md](engineering/testing.md) — the layered test suite, the
  development test runner, and how to run it.
* [engineering/harbor.md](engineering/harbor.md) — downstream guidance for a
  project pushing its own arch-explicit image (hostbootstrap does not push
  project images).
* [engineering/gitignore_guardrails.md](engineering/gitignore_guardrails.md) —
  what must stay out of version control.
