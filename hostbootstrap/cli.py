"""``hostbootstrap`` Click application.

The single entrypoint installed on every downstream host (via
``pip install git+…``). Commands implement §6 of the plan: doctor, build,
cluster up/down/delete, run, base build/push. Each substrate's execution model
(``container`` / ``host-binary`` / ``host-daemon``) is declared in the project's
``hostbootstrap.dhall`` and dispatched here.
