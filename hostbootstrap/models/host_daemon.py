"""``model: host-daemon`` (§9.4, §9.5).

A long-running **host-native** daemon must run on this substrate — typically
Apple-silicon Metal/Tart inference that cannot run in a container. hostbootstrap
builds the binary (and any declared container counterpart) and, on ``cluster
up``, wraps the declared ``daemon`` command in a **system-level** service unit
(a LaunchDaemon on macOS, a system-scope systemd unit on Linux) so it survives
reboots and starts before any user logs in. ``cluster down`` removes the unit.

This is the only model that creates a service unit, because ``daemon`` is the
only field unique to it (and the Dhall schema makes it required here).
